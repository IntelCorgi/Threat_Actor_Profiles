# Threat Actor Tracking

Collected from open source reporting. Associated groups are pulled from [MITRE's helpful group overview.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/) However, note that due to various factors such as visbility, methodology, and reporting guidelines that threat actor activity can overlap or have differences between "associated" threat actor names.

Pull requests welcome!

## UNCs

This project uses the term "UNC" as a catch-all term to describe uncategorized activity groups. The term was [originally coined by Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors) to describe "observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft" analysts aren't ready to designate as a named Threat Actor Group.


| UNC | Attribution | Profile(s) | Comments |
| --- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| UNC2452 | Russia | [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/uncategorized-unc-threat-groups) | "Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that UNC2452 activity aligns with nation-state priorities broadly and that the groupâ€™s targeting patterns are consistent with Russian strategic interests." **First Seen:** 12/2020, **Source Region:** Russia, **Targeted Regions:** 12, **Motivation:** Espionage, **Associated Malware:** BEACON, RAINDROP, SUNSHUTTLE, TEARDROP, **Sub actors:** 6   |
| UNC1878 | Russia | [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/uncategorized-unc-threat-groups) | "UNC1878 is a financially motivated group that monetizes their intrusions by extorting their victims following the deployment of RYUK ransomware. As of September 2020, Mandiant has increasingly observed KEGTAP campaigns as the initial infection vector for UNC1878 operations; previously, UNC1878 used TrickBot for initial access. UNC1878 has used various offensive security tools, most commonly Cobalt Strike BEACON, along with legitimate tools and built-in commands such as PSEXEC, WMI, and BITSadmin." **First Seen:** 09/2020, **Source Region:** Russia, **Targeted Regions:** 16, **Motivation:** Financial Gain, **Associated Malware:** ANCHOR, BEACON, BLUESPINE, CONTI + 23 MORE **Sub actors:** 11 |
| UNC1945 | Unknown | [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/uncategorized-unc-threat-groups) | "UNC1945 is a group that has been observed targeting a number of organizations in the telecommunications, financial, and business services industries since at least early 2018. The goal of UNC1945 is currently unknown because Mandiant has not been able to observe the activities that followed UNC1945 compromises. Based on available information Mandiant has not been able to assess a general location that the group operates from." **First Seen:** 08/2020, **Source Region:** Unknown, **Targeted Regions:** Unknown, **Motivation:** Unknown, **Associated Malware:** AEVILSUN, LEMONSTICK, LOGBLEACH, OPENSHACKLE, SLAPSTICK **Sub actors:** 1 |
| UNC2589 | Unknown | [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/uncategorized-unc-threat-groups) | "UNC2529 is a well-resourced and experienced group that has targeted multiple organizations across numerous industries in a global phishing campaign. They have used phishing emails containing inline links to malicious URLs hosting DOUBLEDRAG malware, a highly obfuscated Javascript downloader. UNC2529 has also used weaponized Microsoft Excel documents as a first stage downloader. DOUBLEDRAG attempts to download a second-stage obfuscated PowerShell memory-only dropper, which Mandiant tracks as DOUBLEDROP, that will launch a backdoor into memory. This third-stage backdoor is tracked as DOUBLEBACK. UNC2529 displayed indications of target research based on their selection of sender email addresses and subject lines which were tailored to their intended victims. Although Mandiant has no data on the objectives of this threat actor, their broad targeting across industries and geographies is consistent with a targeting calculus most commonly seen among financially motivated groups." **First Seen:** 12/2020, **Source Region:** Unknown, **Targeted Regions:** 12, **Motivation:** Unknown, **Associated Malware:** DOUBLEBACK, DOUBLEDRAG, DOUBLEDROP **Sub actors:** 0 |
